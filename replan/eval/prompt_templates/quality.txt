You are an expert in digital image forensics and quality assessment.

You will be given a single digital image.

## Objective:
Your task is to evaluate the overall perceptual quality and authenticity of the image. You must carefully inspect it for any visual artifacts, inconsistencies, or other signs of digital manipulation.

## Evaluation Scale (1 to 5):
You will assign a **quality_score** with the following rules:
- **5 Excellent Quality**: The image appears authentic and is free of any discernible artifacts or inconsistencies. It looks like a high-quality, original photograph.
- **4 Minor Issues**: The image is high-quality overall, but contains very subtle artifacts or inconsistencies (e.g., slight lighting mismatch, unnatural textures, soft edges) that might suggest digital manipulation upon close inspection.
- **3 Noticeable Artifacts**: The image has clear visual flaws or inconsistencies (e.g., distorted textures, illogical shadows, visible seams) that are immediately noticeable and point to digital editing.
- **2 Structural Degradation**: The image contains significant structural errors (e.g., warped shapes, impossible anatomy) or jarring inconsistencies that make it look unnatural.
- **1 Severe Errors**: The image is structurally broken, contains major hallucinations, or has such obvious and poorly executed edits that its artificial nature is undeniable.

## Guidance:
Check the following visual aspects and mark them as ✔ (satisfactory) or ✘ (problematic):
-   **Structural Coherence**: Are all objects in the image plausible and structurally sound? (e.g., correct anatomy, realistic shapes)
-   **Local Consistency**: Are there any localized areas that look out of place with their immediate surroundings in terms of texture, resolution, or noise patterns?
-   **Global Consistency (Lighting & Shadow)**: Is the lighting and shadow consistent across the entire scene?
-   **Boundary Artifacts**: Are there any visible seams, edges, or color shifts that suggest parts of the image have been pasted or blended together?
-   **Overall Artifacts**: Are there any other distracting artifacts elsewhere in the image?

## Input
**Edited Image**:

## Output Format:
After evaluation, provide your score and concise reasoning using the following JSON format:
{{
"reasoning": "Structural Coherence: [✔/✘], Local Consistency: [✔/✘], Global Consistency: [✔/✘], Boundary Artifacts: [✔/✘]. [Brief explanation of any issues found].",
"quality_score": X
